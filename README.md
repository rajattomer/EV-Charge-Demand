# ⚡ EV Charging Demand Prediction

This project predicts electric vehicle (EV) charging demand by analyzing EV population data at the county level. The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and is aimed at supporting infrastructure planning and energy resource allocation for EV adoption.

## 📊 Dataset

**Dataset Name:** EV Population by County

* County Name
* Number of Registered EVs
* Vehicle Types
* Year

## 📌 Objectives

* Analyze EV population distribution across counties.
* Build a model to forecast future EV charging demand.
* Identify high-demand regions to inform infrastructure development.

## 🧠 Future Work

* Incorporate charging station location data
* Use time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet)
* Add real-time traffic or energy consumption data
